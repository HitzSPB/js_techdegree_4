# js_techdegree_4
## This is the TeamTreeHouse JS Fullstack techdegree project # 4

The aim of this project is to reach exceeded expectations degree by completing the task but also adding keyboard input and changes to the styles

### Changes made to the styles
- I have changed the different colors of buttons and displays
- I have changed the margin of the button so the display keyboard keys are closer
- Added font family('Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif) to header element
